# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background
For this assignment, write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. Languages for this assignment are: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.

## Your Task

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `javascript-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: **UFO-level-1** and **UFO-level-2**.

4. Add your **html** files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
